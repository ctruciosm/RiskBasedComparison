To replicate the results reported in Trucíos (2025), use the script `Empirical_Comparison_Large_Panels.R` and set the `market` argument (line 29) as follows:

- Brazilian case: `market <- "B3"`
- US case: `market <- "US"`

The datasets used in this paper are not available in this repository due to licensing restrictions or file-size limitations.
